### Getting Started
 
- Create a GitHub repo named: **increment-decrement-practic**
    - Upload your project files to the repo
    - **No need to share your repo with your teacher**
    - Teacher will discuss your work with you **during Teacher Time**

### Coding Tasks

- Use comments to label each task in your script
  - Example: # Simple Increment and Decrement
- Use f-strings to display the output for each task

#### Simple Increment & Decrement

- Define two variables, `my_score` and `your_score` and assign a different quiz score such as 88 or 93 to each variable
- Use the **increment operator** to increment (increase) the value of `my_score` by 10
- Then use the **decrement operator** to decrement (decrease) the value of `your_score` by 20
- Print the updated value of `my_score` and `your_score` (don't use a while loop to print the values stored in each variable)

#### Counting Up with a While Loop

- Define a variable `counter` and set its starting value to zero (0)
- Set up a while loop that keeps looping while (as long as) the value of `counter` is less than 5
- In the body of your while loop, print the value of your `counter` variable
- Remember to increment the value of your `counter` variable by 1 at the bottom of your while loop

#### Counting Down with a While Loop

- Write a while loop that displays the message 'We have liftoff!' when the value of its counter variable `countedown` reaches 1
- Set the initial value of `countdown` to 10
- While (as long as) the value of `countdown` is greater than zero:
  - print the value of `countdown`
  - decrement the value of the `countdown` variable by 1
  - Your 'We have liftoff!' print statement should be outside the body of your while loop
